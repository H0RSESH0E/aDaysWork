## Description
  I did a much better job managing my time on this assigment.  I made sure that I achieved an MVP before attempting to add any features of my own.

The following is a short description of my experience completing the project:

- I began by evaluating the starter code and making my plan to utilize the planning that was already evident there.
- Working within the constraints of the previous code was actually liberating in a way - the coding was a little like connect the dots instead of starting from a blank slate.
- With an MVP in mind I began with the smallest units and components and worked up from there.
- I got a good deal of satisfaction from meeting the acceptance criteria while including my own upgrade of styling to the buttons to provide clear feedback to the users.
- Using Bootstrap and Moment.js allowed me to quickly add a responsive styling and functionality.
